The head word works as a pointer to the last commits that are made on the current branch where we can delete the unnecessary files by changing the head

*******
# Q4.The problems with the commit message

* The commit should start with intransitive verb like fix x bug
* The commit should be consice and straightforward so the other progammers can undersand it
* The commit should be in just one of these points either fixing the bug or adding the new features to prevent the confusion
* The uncertainty of the tasks or the lack of testing
* The long and unnecessary informations
* The unprofessional language usage

Git is a cloud-based service to store remote repositories. > Github is the one who does that not git
